map should have an entity as a keyvalue pair allowing much more flexibility.
editor knows some keys, e.g. facing and texture.

I would love to have the ability to add singletons without having to enforce Serialize, since some singletons should not be 
serialized, e.g. campaign.
maybe simply implement serialize and deserialize and make them empty / default?

The final screen needs to be updated with a score showing how long time it took to complete the game
and how many pokemon cards were collected vs avaliable.
maybe not super imoportant.

Viktor says there should be a timer which determins when piggy arrives.

Playing a different tune when Piggy sees the player would make the experience better.
When piggy loses sight of the player, or is not following the player, the music resets to a calm tune.
